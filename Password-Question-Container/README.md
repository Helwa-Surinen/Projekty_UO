# Sphere Password and Question Container
/Multilanguage Password and Question Container
Original script by Wpn-z- (This script was created a long time ago, in 2002.)
Contains two TYPES: t_Container_Password and t_Container_Question.
As you need, you enter the TYPE on the container. When using the first one, 
you only enter the password to open it. With the second one, the container owner 
can set a question and its answer.
From Plevel GM can see and operate the container
For proper functioning, it is necessary to use the f_Account_Lang function, which should be placed in the functions folder in the sphere scripts.
